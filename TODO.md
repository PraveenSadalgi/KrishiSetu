# Profile Image Upload Fix

## Current Issue
- Profile image upload is failing
- Currently saves to Supabase storage and database
- User wants to store in localStorage instead

## Tasks
- [ ] Modify handleProfilePictureUpload in Profile component to store image in localStorage as base64
- [ ] Update image display logic to prioritize localStorage over database URL
- [ ] Remove dependency on profileService.uploadProfilePicture
- [ ] Test image upload and persistence

## Implementation Details
- Convert uploaded file to base64 string
- Store with key `profileImage_${user.id}` in localStorage
- Display logic: localStorage first, then database URL, then fallback image
- No database updates needed for profile image
